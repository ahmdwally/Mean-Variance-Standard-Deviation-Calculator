# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This is the boilerplate for the Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator project. Instructions for building your project can be found at [**THIS LINK**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator)

## this is my code for the solution 
### I have used two helper functions inside the calculator function 
1. slicer : which takes a 3x3 list and return a list containing the rows, columns and the flattened array
2. applier : which takes a list and a function and apply function on the child lists and succhild lists of the input list
